Nevertheless, the high potential for recreation of insect pests remains, and a population surge of lots of species can be expected from a low-density level whenever suitable ecological conditions take place or control slackens. Under this plan, bug control was "supervised" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from routine tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
<p>IPM methods consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dosage when other techniques of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, environment adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can rapidly achieve levels at which damage is triggered hence becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy community likely will have a great deal of big, costly houses, so pest control expenses could be greater there since there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those homes.</p>
