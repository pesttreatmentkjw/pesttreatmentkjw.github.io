<p>Cockroaches are among property owners' biggest worries - the really word generates feelings of anxiety and disgust. At the same time, it is also based on semiochemicals especially allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are fended off or discouraged far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). A lot of pesticide issues are brought on by a small number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a reliable and ecologically delicate  technique to pest management that depends on a mix of common-sense practices.

Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the eradication of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).
