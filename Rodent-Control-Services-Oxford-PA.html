IPM coordinates the use of pest biology, ecological details, and readily available innovation to prevent inappropriate levels of pest damage by the most cost-effective ways, while minimizing danger to people, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>Under this plan, insect control was "monitored" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can deal with a large range of pests discovered in Texas, consisting of spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other invaders. Sprays, are best utilized against flying pests and biting pests, such as fleas Most insects will pass away within minutes of coming into contact with an insecticide spray, however some stubborn bugs might make you spray the location several times prior to giving up.</p>

Farmers are confronted with myriad of production challenges where the most common issues are pests, which include diseases, weeds, and insects.
