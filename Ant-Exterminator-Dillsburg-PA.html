Integrated pest management (IPM) is a method that avoids pest damage with minimum adverse influence on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>A biological control program can prosper if these recommendations are followed: 1) properly identify all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural enemies from a dependable biological control provider, 3) make certain there is a constant supply of high quality natural enemies, 4) highlight that appropriate shipping procedures be followed, and 5) get instructions from biological control providers on correct release rates and timing of application.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered hence becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For instance, a rich area likely will have a lot of large, pricey homes, so pest control costs could be greater there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those houses.</p>
