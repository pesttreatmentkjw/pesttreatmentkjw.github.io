Pest exemption with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
