<p>They are offered for 24 hr of emergency pest control services. Fogging pest control is another alternative against adult flying insects such as mosquitoes, flies, moths or flying ants. For weeds biological control, representatives are seed predators, herbivores and plant pathogens, while for plant diseases biological representatives are villains.
