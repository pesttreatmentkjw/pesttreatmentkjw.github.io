<p>IPM (incorporated pest management) mostly includes techniques utilized to prevent plant issues from occurring in the very first place.

Public demand is affected by retail marketing techniques, issues for food safety based upon pesticide regulations in their area, and a lack of knowledge on food production among other factors.</p>
