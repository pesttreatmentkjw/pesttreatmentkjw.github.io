<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest persistence include intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
