Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
