<p>Fire ants would probably top everyone's list when it comes to insect pests! The decision of the correct reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to many insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural enemies than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life phases.</p>
<p>In many cases, they will be. If so, an application of a nonselective insecticide could eliminate them, enabling the pest population to rebound uninhibited by predators and parasites, which may have been supplying considerable control. The pest control market is just beginning to comprehend the chances to improve our business with social and mobile innovation-- but the possibilities are unlimited.</p>
