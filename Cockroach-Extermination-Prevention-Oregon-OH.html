The idea of IPM is to monitor and control pests only when they start appearing and removing the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM techniques, Scope of works, application methods and market specific record keeping procedures.</p>
<p>As the federal authority under the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA), the PMRA establishes pest management policies and guidelines; promotes sustainable pest management; aims to improve the regulatory process to increase effectiveness; enforces compliance with the PCPA; and, disperses pest management information to the general public and key stakeholders.</p>
